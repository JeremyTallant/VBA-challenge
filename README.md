## Background
You will use VBA scripting to analyze generated stock market data.
## Instructions
Create a script that loops through all the stocks for one year and outputs the following information:
* The ticker symbol
* Yearly change from the opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.
* The percentage change from the opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.
* The total stock volume of the stock. The result should match the following image:

* Add functionality to your script to return the stock with the "Greatest % increase", "Greatest % decrease", and "Greatest total volume". The solution should match the following image:

* Make the appropriate adjustments to your VBA script to enable it to run on every worksheet (that is, every year) at once.

## Other Considerations
* Use the sheet `alphabetical_testing.xlsx` while developing your code. This dataset is smaller and will allow you to test faster. Your code should run on this file in under 3 to 5 minutes.

* Make sure that the script acts the same on every sheet. The joy of VBA is that it takes the tediousness out of repetitive tasks with the click of a button.
