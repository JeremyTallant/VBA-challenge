For this assignment we were given a large dataset of stock information where we were instructed to create a VBA script that loops through all the stocks for one year and outputs the following information: 
* Ticker symbol
* Yearly change from the opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.
* The percentage change from the opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.
* The total stock volume of the stock. 
* The greatest percentage increase for each year.
* The greatest percentage decrease for each year.
* The greatest total volume for each year. 

We also had to incorporate conditional formatting in the script that highlighted positive yearly change in green and negative yearly change in red. In this repository you will find a file for the completed assignment titled "VBA-challenge", a file for the VBA code titled "VBA-code", three screenshots of each year of the final results when running the code, and also a file titled "alphabetic-testing" which was used for testing the code due to a smaller dataset than the assignment. The code is accompanied by an outline that breaks down the process step by step.
