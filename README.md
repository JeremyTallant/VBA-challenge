## Background
You will use VBA scripting to analyze generated stock market data.
## Instructions

* Yearly change from the opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.
* The percentage change from the opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.
* The total stock volume of the stock. The result should match the following image:
